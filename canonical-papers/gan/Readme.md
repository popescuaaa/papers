## Generative adversarial networks

---

To try:

- [ ] Conditional GANs
- [ ] Used pretrained discriminator from start to create greater penalty for discriminator.
- [ ] Multiple GANs trained for 10 epochs and then interpolate the weights to compare with a simple gan trained for `N * 10` epochs.
- [ ] The mathematical foundations
